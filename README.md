# BerBot

BerBot is a small robot made using arduino uno, some motors, my poor soldering skills, hot glue and a piece of my shoebox.

You can control BerBot using the BerBotApp I made in React Native. You connect to the BerBot via Bluetooth.

BerBot uses the HC-05 bluetooth module. For "turning" wheels, I used a chair wheel and servo motors and for "power" wheels, I used a gear motor.

Here are some pictures of BerBot.

My first plan was to use 2-gear motors, but I did some things for the second one, so I just used the first one.

Here is a picture of the first one.

In my defense, I only had cheap solder and that's it. I didn't have any form of stand, such as a third hand or some form of stand.

This is how BerBotApp looks. It has 2 pages, home and connect.

And here is a video of BerBot in action (too big for GitHub).
